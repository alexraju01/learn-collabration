# Interview Pairs Generator
## Challenge
In this challenge you will create an application using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allows a practice interview host to quickly generate student pairings. 
- The host will paste a group of student names into the application. 
- The application will then create **pairings for 2 interview sessions**. 
- Each student should act as **both an interviewer and an interviewee**. 
- Pairings must be different between the 1st and 2nd sessions. 
- If there is an odd number of students, a **"mystery interviewer"** should be added automatically to balance the pairs. (This represents the host stepping in.) 
- *Extra*: Add a **copy-to-clipboard** function so the host can easily share the generated pairs for breakout rooms.

## Key Learnings
- Structuring an app with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** 
- Practicing **computational thinking** 
- Applying **problem-solving skills** to real-world classroom scenarios 
- Enhancing usability with **extra features** (clipboard functionality)

## User Story
As a **practice interview host**, 
I want to paste a list of student names into an app, 
So that I can generate fair and unique interview pairings for two sessions, 
And easily copy the results to organize breakout rooms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The user can input or paste a list of student names into the app. 
- [ ] The app generates pairs for **Session 1**. 
- [ ] The app generates **different pairs** for **Session 2**. 
- [ ] Each student is both an **interviewer** and an **interviewee** across the sessions. 
- [ ] If there is an odd number of students, the app adds a **"mystery interviewer"** to balance the pairs. 
- [ ] The pairs are displayed clearly on the page. 
- [ ] (Extra) The user can click a **"Copy to Clipboard"** button to copy all pairs.
